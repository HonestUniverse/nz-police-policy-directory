// File structure:
//	theme
//		Theme files contain SCSS variables and mixins, so they will not generate any CSS on their own.
//		These mixins are part of the theme.
//	tools
//		Tool files contain only mixins and functions, so they will not generate any CSS on their own.
//		These mixins and functions are general purpose, and shouldn't need to change from theme to theme.
//	patterns
//		Pattern files contain mixins that are used to generate variations of similar components, like buttons.
//	base
//		Base files generate CSS that has the lowest priority, such as reset CSS, @font-face declarations, and custom properties on the `:root`.
//	extendables
//		Extendable files contain SCSS placeholder selectors, which may be extended by components.
//	components
//		Component files each contain the SCSS for a single component.

// Doesn't generate CSS
