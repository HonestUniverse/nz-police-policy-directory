// File structure:
//	base
//		Base files generate CSS that has the lowest priority,
//		such as reset CSS, @font-face declarations, and custom properties on the `:root`.
//	theme
//		Theme files contain only SCSS variables, so they will not generate any CSS on their own.
//		These files should be imported where they need to be used.
//		Some variables may only be used within mixins and functions exposed through Tools.
//	tools
//		Tool files contain only mixins and functions, so they will not generate any CSS on their own.
//		These files should be imported where they need to be used.
//	components
//		Component files each detail a single component.
//		They should import any variables, mixins, or functions they may need so they can stand on their own.
