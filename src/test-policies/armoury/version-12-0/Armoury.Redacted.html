	<h3 id="specialist-attendance-and-advice">Specialist attendance and advice</h3>

	<p>Police armourers can give expert advice and may attend crime scenes Involving a firearm at the request of the officer in charge.</p>

	<p>ESR (Environmental Science and Research) staff should attend all serious crime scenes involving a firearm.</p>

	<h3 id="examination-types-and-priorities">Examination types and priorities</h3>

	<p>Different forensic examinations of firearms and related evidence may be necessary depending on the circumstances of each case. The O/C Case should liaise with the Fingerprint Section, ESR and the Police armourer to determine the examination method that will produce the best results and the examination's priority.</p>

	<p>Generally the Armoury's examination is done after the Fingerprint Section and ESR forensic personnel have finished their examinations.</p>

	<h3 id="when-examination-by-police-armourers-is-necessary">When examination by Police armourers is necessary</h3>

	<p>A Police armourer must examine firearms when:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>a person has been Intentionally or accidentally killed or injured by a firearm discharged by another person</li>
		<li>there has been Intentional or accidental self injury or a suicide involving a firearm</li>
		<li>a Police constable has shot at a person, whether or not injury has occurred</li>
		<li>the Independent Police Conduct Authority investigates a Police employee's use of a Police firearm</li>
		<li>the O/C case considers a firearm examination is necessary.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>For information about sending firearms to or from the Armoury for examination, see the <span class="document__link">'Police firearms'</span> chapter of the Police Manual.</p>

	<p><b>Important note</b>: Exhibit firearms should not be stripped or dismantled. They should only be checked to ensure that they do not contain ammunition, and then sent to the Armoury as they are. This avoids the possibility that a firearm that may have been incorrectly disassembled has its functioning affected when it is examined.</p>

	<h3 id="armourers-evidence-report">Armourer's evidence report</h3>

	<p>The examining armourer provides a full evidence report after the examination. It must contain the following subjects and information.</p>
